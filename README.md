# dash-issues (or Dash network issues tracker)
A repository for the top-level Dash (dash.org) network issues. The goal is that all important strategical issues related to the Dash network, which are not currently owned or tracked by any Dash org such as DCG or DIF, are tracked here, prioriotized and lead to concrete proposals.


This repository is mainly used for tracking top level issues. We don't expect that the majority of discussions happen here, but on reddit, Discord channels or Dash forum. However the summary of discussions are reflected here and there will be links to them as well. We are still early in the process and we expect to learn and improve over time.

When creating a new issue, ensure that clearly define the problem, provide enough context and why the issue is important. Also adding links to past discussions within the community is useful. Maintain this repository is a collaborative work by a number of MNOs.
